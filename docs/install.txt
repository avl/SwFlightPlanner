You need to manage postgresql user authenticatino somehow.
The simplest way is probably to edit 
/etc/postgresql/8.4/main/pg_hba.conf
and change "ident" to "trust" for localhost connections.

Prepare database user 'flightplanner':
create ROLE "flightplanner" SUPERUSER LOGIN;

Then you need to change /etc/hosts so that "localhost" only appears for 127.0.0.1, and not for ::1.

Then run, to create the database:
sudo ./resetdb.sh
WARNING! this removes the database if already present!


Not needed anymore:
pyshapelib (Not not in apt-get, download separately. Needs separate download of shapelib as well. Copy pyshapelib into shapelib dir, then sudo python setup.py install)
